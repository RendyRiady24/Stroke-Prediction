# Stroke-Prediction
This project was developed as a final assignment for the Big Data Processing course at BINUS University. We compared the performance of two machine learning models — Random Forest and Naive Bayes — to predict stroke occurrence based on patient health data.

✨Key Insights:

📊Random Forest is better for overall stability but needs improvement in minority class detection.

🌐Naive Bayes is more sensitive but misclassifies too many non-stroke cases.

🚀SMOTE helped balance the training data but class imbalance in the test set remains a challenge.
